# Human Response Time Calculator App

The Human Response Time Calculator App is a simple web application built using Vue.js that allows users to measure their response time. The app presents a block on the screen after a random interval once the "Start" button is clicked, and the user's goal is to click on the block as quickly as possible. The app then calculates and displays the user's response time.
